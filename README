This README file describes what you need to do to build the NcdfUtilities 
executable and library files.


NcdfUtilities Directory Structure:
===============================================================================

The root-level directory is GEOS_5/, which contains these subdirectories:

Code/ : Subdir containing Fortran source code files
bin/  : Subdir where the TestNcdfUtilities.x executable will be sent
doc/  : Subdir where the NcdfUtilities documentation will be built
lib/  : Subdir where the library file libNcUtils.a will be built

NOTE: Each directory also has a "CVS/" subdirectory.  This is for the CVS
version control system, and does not contain any usable files.


System Requirements:
===============================================================================

(1) In order to use NcdfUtilities, you will first have to make sure that the 
netCDF library is installed on your system.  Consult with your local
sysadmin as to where these libraries are found.

If the netCDF library has not yet been installed on your system, then you (or 
your local sysadmin)  will have to install it.  An easy way to do this is to 
obtain the "Baselibs" package from Bob Yantosca and follow the directions on 
the GEOS-Chem wiki page:

http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/Installing_ESMF_and_other_required_libraries#Baselibs


(2) In order to build the reference documents (described below), you must 
have the LaTeX utilities (i.e. latex, dvips, dvipdf) installed on your system.


Building the NcdfUtilities Library:
===============================================================================

The NcdfUtilities/Code directory contains the Fortran source code modules
as well as two Makefiles (named Makefile and Makefile_header.mk).  

The file "Makefile_header.mk" is a sub-makefile which is used to define the
compilation options for different compilers.  At present, the ifort, pgf90,
SunStudio, and IBM XLF compilers are supported.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% NOTE: NcdfUtilities has only been built with the ifort compiler.  If    %%%
%%% you use a different compiler, you may need to port the code yourself!   %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The "Makefile_header.mk" file contains the location of the netCDF library
and include files.  You will have to customize this for your system.  Look 
for these lines of code:

###############################################################################
# Include directory for NETCDF library
# Modify this accordingly for your system!
INC_NC     = -I$(BL_INC_NETCDF)
###############################################################################
# Library link commands for NETCDF library
# Modify this accordingly for your system!
LINK_NC    = -L$(BL_LIB_NETCDF) -lnetcdf -lmpi_cxx -lmpi
###############################################################################

Modify the NC_INC_DIR line to specify the directory path where the 
"netcdf.inc" is found.  A common path for this is /usr/local/include.

Likewise, modify the NC_LIB_DIR line to specify the directory path where the 
netCDF library file "libnetcdf.a"  A common path for this is /usr/local/lib.

After specifying these lines in Makefile_header.mk, you are ready to build the 
executable.  Make sure you are in the Code/ subdirectory and type:

   make lib

This should start building the source code and create a library file
named "libNcUtils.a" in the lib/ subdirectory.  


Testing the NcdfUtilities Library:
===============================================================================

Once the "libNcUtils.a" file has been created in the lib/ subdirectory, you
can test to see if the library was created (and can link to) the netCDF
library correctly.  Type:

   make check

This will create an executable file named "TestNcdfUtilities.x" in the
bin subdirectory, and will also execute the file.  If the libNcUtils.a 
library was installed correctly you should see the following output:

   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   %%%  Testing libNcdfUtilities.a  %%%
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   === Begin netCDF file creation test ===
   Writing XDim (# lons)   to netCDF file
   Writing YDim (# lats)   to netCDF file
   Writing ZDim (# alts)   to netCDF file
   Writing LON  (1D array) to netCDF file
   Writing LAT  (1D array) to netCDF file
   Writing PLEV (1D array) to netCDF file
   Writing PS   (2D array) to netCDF file
   Writing T    (3D array) to netCDF file
   === End netCDF file creation test ===
   === Begin netCDF file reading test ===
   Reading XDim back from netCDF file...........PASSED
   Reading YDim back read from netCDF...........PASSED
   Reading ZDim back from netCDF file...........PASSED
   Reading LON  back from netCDF file...........PASSED
   Reading LAT  back from netCDF file...........PASSED
   Reading PLEV back from netCDF file...........PASSED
   Reading PS   back from netCDF file...........PASSED
   Reading T    back from netCDF file...........PASSED
   === End of netCDF file read test! ===

If all of the tests return with "PASSED" then the libNcUtils.a file was
created correctly and you have 


Building the NcdfUtilities Reference Documentation:
===============================================================================

The NcdfUtilities Fortran source code and Makefiles use the ProTeX automatic 
documentation system.  This enables you to create reference documents in 
*.pdf and *.ps format from the comments in the subroutine headers.

To build the reference documents, make sure you are in the doc/ subdirectory,
then type:

   make doc

This will create the following documents in the doc/ subdirectory:

   NcdfUtilities.pdf               
   NcdfUtilities.ps
   NcdfUtilities.tex
	-- Reference document for the NcdfUtilities Fortran code
           in *.pdf, *.ps, and LaTeX formats


   NcdfUtilities_Makefiles.pdf
   NcdfUtilities_Makefiles.ps
   NcdfUtilities_Makefiles.tex
	-- Reference document for the NcdfUtilities Makefiles
           in *.pdf, *.ps, and LaTeX formats


The reference documents contain a description of each subroutine and function,
the variables that are passed to it as input & output arguments, and the
revision history.  The Makefile reference document displays the full text of 
the Makefiles.  These documents will come in handy if you need to modify
or update the Fortran code or Makefiles. 

If you wish to remove the NcdfUtilities reference documentation files, then 
make sure you are in the doc directory and type:

   make clean


Cleaning up:
===============================================================================

To remove all of the *.o, *.mod and executable file in the Code subdirectory
only, type:

   make clean

However, if you wish to also remove the contents of the bin/ and lib/ 
subdirectories (as well as removing the *.ps, *.pdf, and *.txt files
from the doc/ subdirectory), then type:

   make realclean


That's it.  Good luck and contact me if you have any questions:
